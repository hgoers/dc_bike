## The routes

This website includes routes that combine three great loves of mine: trails, food, and bevvies. Each route includes at least one stop for an amazing feed and a cheeky drink. On your way to these stops, you will travel some of the most interesting and scenic parts of DC and its surrounds.

You do not need to be an advanced cyclist with the latest gear to enjoy these rides. Some are long (but very manageable, I promise!). All are designed to be fun. On that: I loath riding on roads, particularly in the Wild West of DC, Virginia, and (*shudders)* Maryland. I avoid them as best I can. None of these routes will spit you out onto a busy road. Largely, they take advantage of DC's wonderful cycle ways.

Finally, you do not need a car to enjoy these routes. By default, I start them from L'Enfant Station, which is accessible by Metro, MARC, VRE, and Amtrak. I will either get you back to the start or drop you off by a Metro or train station.

## The bike

Almost any bike will carry you happily and safely through these routes. I will note in the route descriptions when I think you need specific gear, including wide tires.

My bike is wonderful, but nothing fancy. I bought it second-hand for \$300 (an astonishing amount of money for a student, but pennies compared to what you can spend on a bike). Here are some relevant specs:

**Brand and model:** Specialized 2019 Women's Sirrus

**Frame:** Aluminum with a fitness geometry (read: comfortable, but you can tuck into a speedier position when needed)

**Wheels:** 700x32mm sport

**Gearing:** 3x8 (48/38/28T at the front and 11-32t at the back)

You can safely assume that you are able, at a minimum, to comfortably ride these routes on a similar bike (yes, even the C&O Canal Towpath).

## Me

I am an Australian and PhD student who has lived in DC since 2021. I am relatively new to cycling. In April 2024, I tore my ACL. For the first five months after surgery, cycling was the only sport I could do. I completed my first century ride before I was cleared to jog for the bus. I recommend biking to anyone with similar injuries: it is a relatively low-impact sport that allows you to see more sights than the bottom of your local swimming pool.

These routes are, therefore, accessible to those who are new to the sport or who do not consider themselves to be very fit. I recommend starting with some of the shorter routes and working your way up to the centuries. For months, the full extent of my cycling involved commuting to work on a Capital BikeShare bike. Only recently did the allure of Rock Creek Park prompt me to get my own bike. I signed up for WABA's 50 States Ride (perhaps under the influence of one of those cheeky bevvies) and found a good-looking, secondâ€“hand bike. I well and truly caught the bug, so this collection of routes also includes plenty for those whose bike features concerning regularly in their dreams.
