Sometimes you just need to sit by the water and drink a cocktail with a tiny umbrella in it. This easy loop gives you just that.

## The route

Starting from L'Enfant Station, head up to the Mall. Ride along the Mall or down the Independence Ave protected bike lane to the National Monument. . When you get to the Washington Monument, continue to take the protected bike lane on to the Ohio Drive Cycle track. When you get to the Jefferson Memorial, cross over the 14th St Bridge.

Take the U-turn and head South-East along the Mt Vernon Trail. Stop at Gravelly Point to see planes land almost on top of you as they come into DCA.

Continue along the Mt Vernon Trail until Potomac Yard. Follow the signs for Catboat Pizza Bar (to your left down Marina Drive). Enjoy a cocktail, slice of pizza, and great view of the river.

Once you're ready, head back the way you came along the Mt Vernon Trail. Instead of turning off onto the 14th St Bridge, continue straight across the smaller Humpback Bridge. Follow the looping trail in a sweeping right-hand turn. Your next stop - Island Time Bar & Grill - sits just under the parkway.

Grab a pitcher of beer and head out to the seats by the water. You will be joined by many cheery ducks.

When you've finished that (or a number of pitchers), head back under the parkway. Follow the Mt Vernon Trail up towards the Arlington Memorial Bridge, which you can cross to get back to DC. Follow the Mall across to your starting point.

## The bike

This route is paved and flat, so any old bike will do! Please note: there are no Capital Bikeshare docks near Island Time Bar & Grill and it is in a restricted zone (you cannot leave a CaBi e-bike there). So you need to bring your own bike.
