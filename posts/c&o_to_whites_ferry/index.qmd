This all-day ride takes you out to **White's Ferry Store and Grill** along the C&O Canal Towpath. This is a fun, easy gravel trail filled with plenty of wildlife, including birds and turtles. You will be rewarded with a good burger and beer before heading back to town.

## The route

This route starts L'Enfant Station. Head up to the Mall. Pass the National Monument and Lincoln Memorial. Head North along the protected Rock Creek Trail. At Georgetown (K St NW), turn left onto the Capital Crescent Trail (CCT). Keep going straight and you will end up on the C&O Canal Trail.

You can skip first (and last) 6 miles of the gravelly C&O Canal Trail. Instead, stay on the paved CCT.

Once you are on the C&O Canal Trail, you are a straight-shot through to Whites Ferry. There are plenty of great things to see along the way. At the 17 mile mark, you will pass Great Falls. A brilliant view of these falls lies a very short walk from the trail. 

You should get into **White's Ferry Store and Grill** at around lunch time. They have a wide selection of food, including burgers and wraps. They also have a wide selection of craft beer in tinnies. They have indoor seating, but I prefer to sit on one of the many benches and tables next to the Potomac River. You can still see the (now out-of-use) White's Ferry. 

Once you have had your fill, you can head back along the route you came. **Old Anglers Inn** looks like a good spot for an afternoon drink (they also have food). It sits at the 55-mile mark, right near Great Falls. Please note, this area gets very busy in the afternoon on weekends.  

You will round out your metric century when you return to Georgetown. 

## The bike

This is a flat gravel route. You will be most comfortable on a bike with 35mm+ wide tires. That being said, I have ridden this route several times on my hybrid/commuter Specialized Women's Sirrus, fitted with 700x32mm sport tires. 

You do not need many gears to tackle this largely flat route. In fact, I once rode it on a fixie: my shifting cable gave out on my Sirrus at the start but I really wanted to head out.
