This all-day ride takes you out to Purcellville, VA along the Washington & Old Dominion (W&OD) Trail. You will enjoy many great brews, a very well-deserved burger, and a smooth, protected ride along one of DC's longest cycle trails.

## The route

This route starts from L'Enfant Station. From there, you head towards the Mall. You can take the protected bike lane running down Independence Ave, or head down the Mall itself. When you get to the Washington Monument, continue to take the protected bike lane on to the Ohio Drive Cycle track. When you get to the Jefferson Memorial, cross over the 14th St Bridge.

Take the U-turn and head South-East along the Mt Vernon Trail. Stop at Gravelly Point to see planes land almost on top of you as they come into DCA. Continue to follow the trail until you come to the end of the airport.

Take a right onto the Four Mile Run. Take this to the W&OD Trailhead. You will need to cross the busy Shirlington Rd to get there, but there is a pedestrian crossing. From there, it's a straight shot through to Purcellville.

I made it into town for lunch. Not wanting to stray too far from the trail, I headed to **Market Burger Fries & Shakes**, which has a wide selection of burgers and some local craft beers from which to choose. They source all of their produce from local farms. They very kindly threw in some amazing fried green tomatoes (perhaps they took pity on my tired-self). Although they have plenty of indoor seating, I headed back to the trail head to enjoy my spread.

If you get hungry ahead of Purcellville, or you would like to start on the way home before stopping for a big lunch, a popular stop is the **Carolina Brothers Pit Barbeque** in Ashburn (at the 34- or 69-mile mark).

After that, you head back the way you came. My next stop was all the way back on the outskirts of Vienna: the **Caboose Brewing Company and Tavern** (at the 85-mile mark). This is a very popular afternoon stop for cyclists. It was packed! They have a huge selection of great beers and a busy kitchen. I smashed the Single Track Pale Ale. It was perfect.

After this stop, you'll probably be keen to make it home. You will round out this Imperial century back at the Mall.

## The alternatives

If you would like a shorter route, you can head out to Ashburn. Get your fill at the **Carolina Brothers Pit Barbeque**. Ending back at L'Enfant Station, you will have ridden 68 miles.

Alternatively, you can have a shorter day by heading out to **Caboose Brewing Company and Tavern**. This alternate route is 37 mile-long.

## The bike

The entire route is paved. There are some short climbs. Whatever bike you have is perfect. In fact, I have seen all kinds of bikes on the W&OD: from TTs to fat bikes.
