This route takes you up the length of Rock Creek Park to the best fish and chips I've had in the US. Enjoy them as a picnic in the park.

## The route

This route starts at L'Enfant Station. Head towards the Mall and then turn left on the Independence Ave protected bike lane. Pass the National Monument and Lincoln Memorial. Head North along the protected Rock Creek Trail. Follow the Rock Creek Trail all the way up to the Maryland border. Along the way, you will pass the Zoo. The route is shady and protected. Many parts of the park are closed to cars on the weekend, so you will share the road with other cyclists and runners. 

Just before the border with Maryland, take a right on to West Beach Drive. Cars do use this road, but tend to take it slowly. Take a left on to the appropriately named Grubb Rd. **Parkway Deli and Restaurant** is tucked off to the left.

They did a great fish and chips. I also highly recommend the Reuben. If you will have room, try some of their amazing-looking cakes. They also have large fridges full of beers to choose from.

You can sit outside with your bike to enjoy. However, I recommend heading back into the park and having a picnic. There are some very nice spots to set up a picnic blanket or some tables and chairs across the route you just took. 

From Parkway Deli you can head back the way you came or head a short way to the Silver Spring Metro Station. 

## The bike

This route is paved and flat. Any old bike will do!
