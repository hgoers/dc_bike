This route never takes you far from town, but you will be able to enjoy some lush trails and plenty of good food and beers. It takes you via the Anacostia River Trail to some of the DMV's best tacos. You will then be able to enjoy a smorgasbord of beer at a series of bike-friendly breweries. You end along the Metropolitian Beer Trail.

## The route

This route starts at L'Enfant Station. You head South along a protected bike lane to Navy Yard. Head across South Capitol St SW Bridge (or, as I like to call it: the many arches bridge). Follow the path, which will connect you into the Anacostia River Trail.

Follow the trail all the way up into Maryland. You should see plenty of wildlife, including some deer. When you pass under the Baltimore Ave Bridge you will link onto the Northeast Branch Trail. Keep going straight along this trail.

When you reach College Park, you will ride around the College Park Airport. If you do this trip during the day you may see a light plane land. At this point, you are close to tacos. Take the left on to Paint Branch Trail. Follow this until you hit the Rhode-Island Ave Trolley Trail.

Follow the Trolley Trail until you hit the Berwyn Road intersection. Turn right and you will be at **Tacos A la Madre**. You can park your bike outside (they have a pole for this purpose). Tacos A la Madre serve sensational Mexican food. I recommend any and all tacos and the tostada. They also have a selection of beers.

Once you are ready, hop back on the Rhode-Island Ave Trolley Trail. Follow this all the way to your next stop: the **Streetcar 82 Brewing Co**. This is a very bike-friendly brewery with a large selection of great beers. They often also have a food truck parked outside.

After the brewery, head a short distance down the road to Melrose Park. Here you will be able to join the Rachel Carson Greenway Trail. Follow this until you get to 16th Ave. Here, you have to get on a series of quiet side roads (interspersed by some large-road crossings, all of which have pedestrian crossings). Follow the map through to Fort Totten Metro Station.

From here, you join the Metropolitan Branch Trail (better referred to as the Metropolitan Beer Trail!). This will take you to by some of DC's best dive bars and breweries. Follow your heart to your bevvies of choice, but I recommend **City State Brewery**, **metrobar**, **Lost Generation Brewery**, and finishing at **Red Bear Brewery**.

The route finishes at Union Station. Stumble home responsibly!
