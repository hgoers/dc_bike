I avoid them as best I can. None of these routes will spit you out onto a busy road. Largely, they take advantage of DC’s wonderful cycle ways.\nFinally, you do not need a car to enjoy these routes. By default, I start them from L’Enfant Station, which is accessible by Metro, MARC, VRE, and Amtrak. I will either get you back to the start or drop you off by a Metro or train station."

I will note in the route descriptions when I think you need specific gear, including wide tires.\nMy bike is wonderful, but nothing fancy. I bought it second-hand for $300 (an astonishing amount of money for a student, but pennies compared to what you can spend on a bike). Here are some relevant specs:\nBrand and model: Specialized 2019 Women’s Sirrus\nFrame: Aluminum with a fitness geometry (read: comfortable, but you can tuck into a speedier position when needed)\nWheels: 700x32mm sport\nGearing: 3x8 (48/38/28T at the front and 11-32t at the back)\nYou can safely assume that you are able, at a minimum, to comfortably ride these routes on a similar bike (yes, even the C&O Canal Towpath)."

    "text": "Me\nI am an Australian and PhD student who has lived in DC since 2021. I am relatively new to cycling. In April 2024, I tore my ACL. For the first five months after surgery, cycling was the only sport I could do. I completed my first century ride before I was cleared to jog for the bus. I recommend biking to anyone with similar injuries: it is a relatively low-impact sport that allows you to see more sights than the bottom of your local swimming pool.\nThese routes are, therefore, accessible to those who are new to the sport or who do not consider themselves to be very fit. I recommend starting with some of the shorter routes and working your way up to the centuries. For months, the full extent of my cycling involved commuting to work on a Capital BikeShare bike. Only recently did the allure of Rock Creek Park prompt me to get my own bike. I signed up for WABA’s 50 States Ride (perhaps under the influence of one of those cheeky bevvies) and found a good-looking, second–hand bike. I well and truly caught the bug, so this collection of routes also includes plenty for those whose bike features concerning regularly in their dreams."

    "text": "The route\nThis route starts from L’Enfant Station. From there, you head towards the Mall. You can take the protected bike lane running down Independence Ave, or head down the Mall itself. When you get to the Washington Monument, continue to take the protected bike lane on to the Ohio Drive Cycle track. When you get to the Jefferson Memorial, cross over the 14th St Bridge.\nTake the U-turn and head South-East along the Mt Vernon Trail. Stop at Gravelly Point to see planes land almost on top of you as they come into DCA. Continue to follow the trail until you come to the end of the airport.\nTake a right onto the Four Mile Run. Take this to the W&OD Trailhead. You will need to cross the busy Shirlington Rd to get there, but there is a pedestrian crossing. From there, it’s a straight shot through to Purcellville.\nI made it into town for lunch. Not wanting to stray too far from the trail, I headed to Market Burger Fries & Shakes, which has a wide selection of burgers and some local craft beers from which to choose. They source all of their produce from local farms. They very kindly threw in some amazing fried green tomatoes (perhaps they took pity on my tired-self). Although they have plenty of indoor seating, I headed back to the trail head to enjoy my spread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you get hungry ahead of Purcellville, or you would like to start on the way home before stopping for a big lunch, a popular stop is the Carolina Brothers Pit Barbeque in Ashburn (at the 34- or 69-mile mark).\n\n\nAfter that, you head back the way you came. My next stop was all the way back on the outskirts of Vienna: the Caboose Brewing Company and Tavern (at the 85-mile mark). This is a very popular afternoon stop for cyclists. It was packed! They have a huge selection of great beers and a busy kitchen. I smashed the Single Track Pale Ale. It was perfect.\nAfter this stop, you’ll probably be keen to make it home. You will round out this Imperial century back at the Mall."

Many parts of the park are closed to cars on the weekend, so you will share the road with other cyclists and runners.\nJust before the border with Maryland, take a right on to West Beach Drive. Cars do use this road, but tend to take it slowly. Take a left on to the appropriately named Grubb Rd. Parkway Deli and Restaurant is tucked off to the left.\nThey did a great fish and chips. I also highly recommend the Reuben. If you will have room, try some of their amazing-looking cakes. They also have large fridges full of beers to choose from.\nYou can sit outside with your bike to enjoy. However, I recommend heading back into the park and having a picnic. There are some very nice spots to set up a picnic blanket or some tables and chairs across the route you just took.\nFrom Parkway Deli you can head back the way you came or head a short way to the Silver Spring Metro Station."

Keep going straight and you will end up on the C&O Canal Trail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can skip first (and last) 6 miles of the gravelly C&O Canal Trail. Instead, stay on the paved CCT.\n\n\nOnce you are on the C&O Canal Trail, you are a straight-shot through to Whites Ferry. There are plenty of great things to see along the way. At the 17 mile mark, you will pass Great Falls. A brilliant view of these falls lies a very short walk from the trail.\nYou should get into White’s Ferry Store and Grill at around lunch time. They have a wide selection of food, including burgers and wraps. They also have a wide selection of craft beer in tinnies. They have indoor seating, but I prefer to sit on one of the many benches and tables next to the Potomac River. You can still see the (now out-of-use) White’s Ferry.\nOnce you have had your fill, you can head back along the route you came. Old Anglers Inn looks like a good spot for an afternoon drink (they also have food). It sits at the 55-mile mark, right near Great Falls. Please note, this area gets very busy in the afternoon on weekends.\nYou will round out your metric century when you return to Georgetown."

Head across South Capitol St SW Bridge (or, as I like to call it: the many arches bridge). Follow the path, which will connect you into the Anacostia River Trail.\nFollow the trail all the way up into Maryland. You should see plenty of wildlife, including some deer. When you pass under the Baltimore Ave Bridge you will link onto the Northeast Branch Trail. Keep going straight along this trail.\nWhen you reach College Park, you will ride around the College Park Airport. If you do this trip during the day you may see a light plane land. At this point, you are close to tacos. Take the left on to Paint Branch Trail. Follow this until you hit the Rhode-Island Ave Trolley Trail.\nFollow the Trolley Trail until you hit the Berwyn Road intersection. Turn right and you will be at Tacos A la Madre. You can park your bike outside (they have a pole for this purpose). Tacos A la Madre serve sensational Mexican food. I recommend any and all tacos and the tostada. They also have a selection of beers.\nOnce you are ready, hop back on the Rhode-Island Ave Trolley Trail. Follow this all the way to your next stop: the Streetcar 82 Brewing Co. This is a very bike-friendly brewery with a large selection of great beers. They often also have a food truck parked outside.\nAfter the brewery, head a short distance down the road to Melrose Park. Here you will be able to join the Rachel Carson Greenway Trail. Follow this until you get to 16th Ave. Here, you have to get on a series of quiet side roads (interspersed by some large-road crossings, all of which have pedestrian crossings). Follow the map through to Fort Totten Metro Station.\nFrom here, you join the Metropolitan Branch Trail (better referred to as the Metropolitan Beer Trail!). This will take you to by some of DC’s best dive bars and breweries. Follow your heart to your bevvies of choice, but I recommend City State Brewery, metrobar, Lost Generation Brewery, and finishing at Red Bear Brewery.\nThe route finishes at Union Station. Stumble home responsibly!"
